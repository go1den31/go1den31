# 👋 Hi, I'm Mark  

Documenting my **homelab journey**, server builds, and self-hosted services.  
Learning DevOps fundamentals through real hands-on projects on my own hardware.

- Immich (photo backup)
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Cloudflare SSL / DNS

- daily summaries at 07:00  

### 🔹 Docker Compose Setups
Clean and minimal docker-compose configurations for services I run at home.
